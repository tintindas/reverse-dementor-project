    title: `You Want a Social Life, with Friends`,
    poet: `Kenneth Koch`,
    text: `You want a social life, with friends.
        A passionate love life and as well
        To work hard every day. What's true
        Is of these three you may have two
        And two can pay you dividends
        But never may have three.
        
        There isn't time enough, my friends--
        Though dawn begins, yet midnight ends--
        To find the time to have love, work, and friends.
        Michelangelo had feeling
        For Vittoria and the Ceiling
        But did he go to parties at day's end?
        
        Homer nightly went to banquets
        Wrote all day but had no lockets
        Bright with pictures of his Girl.
        I know one who loves and parties
        And has done so since his thirties
        But writes hardly anything at all.

    title: `Vigil `,
    poet: `Dennis O'Driscoll`,
    text: `Life is too short to sleep through.
        Stay up late, wait until the sea of traffic ebbs,
        until noise has drained from the world
        like blood from the cheeks of the full moon.
        Everyone else around you has succumbed:
        they lie like tranquillised pets on a vet's table;
        they languish on hospital trolleys and friends' couches,
        on iron beds in hostels for the homeless,
        under feather duvets at tourist B&Bs.
        The radio, devoid of listeners to confide in,
        turns repetitious. You are your own voice-over.
        You are alone in the bone-weary tower
        of your bleary-eyed, blinking lighthouse,
        watching the spillage of tide on the shingle inlet.
        You are the single-minded one who hears
        time shaking from the clock's fingertips
        like drops, who watches its hands
        chop years into diced seconds,
        who knows that when the church bell
        tolls at 2 or 3 it tolls unmistakably for you.
        You are the sole hand on deck when
        temperatures plummet and the hull
        of an iceberg is jostling for prominence.
        Your confidential number is the life-line
        where the sedated long-distance voices
        of despair hold out muzzily for an answer.
        You are the emergency services' driver
        ready to dive into action at the first
        warning signs of birth or death.
        You spot the crack in night's façade
        even before the red-eyed businessman
        on look-out from his transatlantic seat.
        You are the only reliable witness to when
        the light is separated from the darkness,
        who has learned to see the dark in its true
        colours, who has not squandered your life.

    title: `Weekends, Sleeping In`,
    poet: `Marjorie Saiser`,
    text: `No jump-starting the day,
        no bare feet slapping the floor
        to bath and breakfast.
        
        Dozing instead
        in the nest
        like, I suppose,
        a pair of gophers
        
        underground
        in fuzz and wood shavings.
        One jostles the other
        in closed-eye luxury.
        
        We are at last
        perhaps
        what we are:
        
        uncombed,
        unclothed,
        mortal.

        and dream.

    poet: `Wendy Cope`,
    text: `Some men never think of it.
        You did. You'd come along
        And say you'd nearly brought me flowers
        But something had gone wrong.
        
        The shop was closed. Or you had doubts -
        The sort that minds like ours
        Dream up incessantly. You thought
        I might not want your flowers.
        
        It made me smile and hug you then.
        Now I can only smile.
        But look, the flowers you nearly brought
        Have lasted all this while.

    poet: ` Robert Bly`,
    text: `There are more like us. All over the world
        There are confused people, who can’t remember
        The name of their dog when they wake up, and people
        Who love God but can’t remember where
        
        He was when they went to sleep. It’s
        All right. The world cleanses itself this way.
        A wrong number occurs to you in the middle
        Of the night, you dial it, it rings just in time
        
        To save the house. And the second-story man
        Gets the wrong address, where the insomniac lives,
        And he’s lonely, and they talk, and the thief
        Goes back to college. Even in graduate school,
        
        You can wander into the wrong classroom,
        And hear great poems lovingly spoken
        By the wrong professor. And you find your soul,

    title: `There Are No Boring People in This World`,
    poet: `Yevgeny Yevtushenko`,
    text: `There are no boring people in this world.
        Each fate is like the history of a planet.
        And no two planets are alike at all.
        Each is distinct – you simply can’t compare it.
        
        If someone lived without attracting notice
        and made a friend of their obscurity –
        then their uniqueness was precisely this.
        Their very plainness made them interesting.
        
        Each person has a world that’s all their own.
        Each of those worlds must have its finest moment
        and each must have its hour of bitter torment –
        and yet, to us, both hours remain unknown.
        
        When people die, they do not die alone.
        They die along with their first kiss, first combat.
        They take away their first day in the snow …
        All gone, all gone – there’s just no way to stop it.
        
        There may be much that’s fated to remain,
        but something – something leaves us all the same.
        The rules are cruel, the game nightmarish –
        it isn’t people but whole worlds that perish.

        migrating birds and the flower
        vendor wreathed in yellow light --
        this city is safe from a safe distance
        you said, buying yourself a longstem
        rose for the long ride home, and kissed
        me under the canopy -- it was after midnight
        the air was cold you had raindrops in your
        hair the smoke of centuries wreathed us
        both in a delicate envelope of rain –
        
        you took my hand and smiled at the homeless man balancing the world on metal crutches at the bottom of the subway stairs
        
        how easy it is, you said, to be a little kind

    poet: `Emily Montgomery`,
    text: `I wanted to save something beautiful for you.
        The last three jewels of glistening pomegranate
        balanced in the palm of my hand before I ate them.
        The morning birdsong in the lemon tree after you left for work,
        the memory of last night’s rain still written on the lawn.
        Or earlier, the haunting roundness of the moon
        over the canyon just before dawn when I couldn’t sleep,
        standing at the window, looking back at you, your body
        floating in the watery moonlight of our sheets.
        I mean something really beautiful, my love.
        The stillness in the house after the washing machine
        ceased to hum. The last line from a slender book of poems,
        a hardback from the library barely worn, repeated aloud for you,
        its bitter sweetness still lingering on my tongue.
        Or the way the baby slept so deeply while I read,
        burying himself in the secret scent of his favorite blanket.
        One arm thrown across that woolen teddy my mother gave us
        in those final weeks of waiting before his birth.
        The other hand open wide, fingers outstretched in a dancer’s
        graceful, expectant pose. I wanted to save all of this for you.
        But I couldn’t. It didn’t last. It never does.
        That brief moment of grace when the ordinary shines so exquisitely.
        At the end of the day you will return to us, as you always do,
        and we will both be tired, empty, distracted, spent.
        Everything more chaotic, more fragile, than when you left.

        Cigarettes will kill you. 
        Yes does not always mean yes.
        How kind you are to people
        sometimes does not matter.
        Coffee is bad for you. 
        8 hours of sleep should not be a goal;
        it should always be a reality.
        Green vegetables will keep you 
        young for as long as you eat them.
        Nothing will ever be as beautiful
        as your solitude.
        Breathing deeply can calm you down
        in any situation. 
        Mediation will center you
        but only for a short time.
        Love will hold you together

        When no one comes to disturb my inward peace, 
        When no one comes to take me away from myself 
        And turn me into a patchwork, a jig-saw puzzle, 
        A broken mirror that once gave a whole reflection, 
        Being so contrived that it takes too long a time 
        To get myself back to myself when they have gone. 
        The years are too strictly measured, and life too short 
        For me to afford such bits of myself to my friends. 
        And what have I to give my friends in the last resort? 
        An awkwardness, a shyness, and a scrap, 
        No thing that's truly me, a bootless waste, 
        A waste of myself and them, for my life is mine 
        And theirs presumably theirs, and cannot touch.

        the thought of it. Sometimes
        
        the oily smell of an evening flower appears 
        and hangs in the air, a slightly browner spot.
        
        I think most people had it wrong when they said 
        forget about it and find a fresh patch 
        of grass to lie down in.
        
        There are prayers, though, 
        about that kind of peace.
        
        I have to admit, sometimes 
        I want nothing more than to be lying on the bottom 
        of an unimpressive river.
        
        I can watch all the leaves and sticks skim over my head, 
        and no one will bother me 
        because they’re swimming 
        in the more impressive rivers.
        
        The water’s not too cold. It doesn’t feel 
        like being dead.
        
        It also doesn’t feel like being old 
        or fetal.
        
        I came to the humble water to lie down.

        Get some sleep.
        
        Don't give advice.
        
        Take care of your teeth and gums.
        
        Don't be afraid of anything beyond your control. Don't be afraid, for
        instance, that the building will collapse as you sleep, or that someone
        you love will suddenly drop dead.
        
        Eat an orange every morning.
        
        Be friendly. It will help make you happy.
        
        Raise your pulse rate to 120 beats per minute for 20 straight minutes
        four or five times a week doing anything you enjoy.
        
        Hope for everything. Expect nothing.
        
        Take care of things close to home first. Straighten up your room
        before you save the world. Then save the world.
        
        Know that the desire to be perfect is probably the veiled expression
        of another desire—to be loved, perhaps, or not to die.
        
        Make eye contact with a tree.
        
        Be skeptical about all opinions, but try to see some value in each of
        them.
        
        Dress in a way that pleases both you and those around you.
        
        Do not speak quickly.
        
        Learn something every day. (Dzien dobre!)
        
        Be nice to people before they have a chance to behave badly.
        
        Don't stay angry about anything for more than a week, but don't
        forget what made you angry. Hold your anger out at arm's length
        and look at it, as if it were a glass ball. Then add it to your glass ball
        collection.
        
        Be loyal.
        
        Wear comfortable shoes.
        
        Design your activities so that they show a pleasing balance
        and variety.
        
        Be kind to old people, even when they are obnoxious. When you
        become old, be kind to young people. Do not throw your cane at
        them when they call you Grandpa. They are your grandchildren!
        
        Live with an animal.

        If someone murders your child, get a shotgun and blow his head off.
        
        Plan your day so you never have to rush.
        
        Show your appreciation to people who do things for you, even if you
        have paid them, even if they do favors you don't want.
        
        Do not waste money you could be giving to those who need it.
        
        Expect society to be defective. Then weep when you find that it is far
        more defective than you imagined.
        
        When you borrow something, return it in an even better condition.
        
        As much as possible, use wooden objects instead of plastic or metal

        Visit foreign countries, except those whose inhabitants have
        expressed a desire to kill you.
        
        Don't expect your children to love you, so they can, if they want to.
        
        Meditate on the spiritual. Then go a little further, if you feel like it.
        What is out (in) there?
        
        Sing, every once in a while.
        
        Be on time, but if you are late do not give a detailed and lengthy
        excuse.
        
        Don't be too self-critical or too self-congratulatory.
        
        Don't think that progress exists. It doesn't.

        anything to make it impossible.
        
        Take your phone off the hook at least twice a week.
        
        Keep your windows clean.
        
        Extirpate all traces of personal ambitiousness.
        
        Don't use the word extirpate too often.
        
        Forgive your country every once in a while. If that is not possible, go
        to another one.
        
        If you feel tired, rest.
        
        Grow something.
        
        Do not wander through train stations muttering, "We're all going to
        die!"
        
        Count among your true friends people of various stations of life.
        
        Appreciate simple pleasures, such as the pleasure of chewing, the
        pleasure of warm water running down your back, the pleasure of a
        cool breeze, the pleasure of falling asleep.
        
        Do not exclaim, "Isn't technology wonderful!"
        
        Learn how to stretch your muscles. Stretch them every day.
        
        Don't be depressed about growing older. It will make you feel even
        older. Which is depressing.
        
        Do one thing at a time.
        
        If you burn your finger, put it in cold water immediately. If you bang
        your finger with a hammer, hold your hand in the air for twenty
        minutes. You will be surprised by the curative powers of coldness and
        gravity.
        
        Learn how to whistle at earsplitting volume.
        
        Be calm in a crisis. The more critical the situation, the calmer you
        should be.
        
        Enjoy sex, but don't become obsessed with it. Except for brief periods
        in your adolescence, youth, middle age, and old age.
        
        Contemplate everything's opposite.
        
        If you're struck with the fear that you've swum out too far in the
        ocean, turn around and go back to the lifeboat.
        
        Keep your childish self alive.
        
        Answer letters promptly. Use attractive stamps, like the one with a
        tornado on it.
        
        Cry every once in a while, but only when alone. Then appreciate
        how much better you feel. Don't be embarrassed about feeling better.
        
        Do not inhale smoke.
        
        Take a deep breath.
        
        Do not smart off to a policeman.
        
        Do not step off the curb until you can walk all the way across the
        street. From the curb you can study the pedestrians who are trapped
        in the middle of the crazed and roaring traffic.
        
        Be good.
        
        Walk down different streets.
        
        Backwards.
        
        Remember beauty, which exists, and truth, which does not. Notice
        that the idea of truth is just as powerful as the idea of beauty.
        
        Stay out of jail.
        
        In later life, become a mystic.
        
        Use Colgate toothpaste in the new Tartar Control formula.
        
        Visit friends and acquaintances in the hospital. When you feel it is
        time to leave, do so.
        
        Be honest with yourself, diplomatic with others.
        
        Do not go crazy a lot. It's a waste of time.
        
        Read and reread great books.

        27-batter, 27-out game in baseball.
        
        Drink plenty of water. When asked what you would like to drink,
        say, "Water, please."
        
        Ask "Where is the loo?" but not "Where can I urinate?"

        It's the same when love comes to an end,
        or the marriage fails and people say
        they knew it was a mistake, that everybody
        said it would never work. That she was 
        old enough to know better. But anything
        worth doing is worth doing badly.
        Like being there by that summer ocean
        on the other side of the island while
        love was fading out of her, the stars 
        burning so extravagantly those nights that
        anyone could tell you they would never last.
        Every morning she was asleep in my bed
        like a visitation, the gentleness in her
        like antelope standing in the dawn mist.
        Each afternoon I watched her coming back
        through the hot stony field after swimming,
        the sea light behind her and the huge sky
        on the other side of that. Listened to her
        while we ate lunch. How can they say 
        the marriage failed? Like the people who
        came back from Provence (when it was Provence)
        and said it was pretty but the food was greasy.
        I believe Icarus was not failing as he fell,
        but just coming to the end of his triumph.

        All conserved and transformed, converted,
        but steady in their keeping, curling back in waves.

        with the broken ankle and the pain
        of a broken ankle, even with sorrow,
        even the invisible soul, that cup of liquid condensing
        into clouds and on the coldest days falling
        as snow where the new filly drags her muzzle,
        then lifts her head, her eyes, the eyes of your great–aunt

        of coffee cake and ripe peaches,
        and love even the floor which needs to be swept,
        the soiled linens and scratched records…..
        Since there is no place large enough
        to contain so much happiness,

        into everything you touch. You are not responsible.

        her shallow breath means her lungs are deflating,

        her. If he asks me if it’s painful, well.

        is littered with her loss of strength:
        untouched water bottle, food pellets
        staling in the pink plastic bowl.

        that in his grief he might learn the hard fact
        of life. We named it mercy. We named it introduction.
        Better now than let sorrow catch him later.

        knowing how much you love fruit
        (not to eat, of course, but to examine),

        a lone pear, which may signify
        something to you I haven’t intended,
        which is my intention.
        No doubt you’ve begun to question
        why the quince and the apple
        are so close together, and (knowing you)
        if there might be a worm
        in the apple, whether this gift
        is a gift at all. And perhaps it’s true
        that I’ve covered up the worm hole
        with putty, painted over it perfectly,
        though this would be a mystery
        that only can be solved
        by cutting open or biting into,
        letting the juices run down the sides
        of your mouth, or onto your hands.
        It would be the kind of bold probing
        I would love for you to love, the final
        messiness of theory, still-life breaking open
        into life, the discovery that the secret worm,
        if real, will not permit you any distance.

    and it’s a road you can only learn by walking it,
    a dance you cannot be taught,
    a song that did not exist before you began, together, to sing.
    And because in the darkness you will reach out a hand,
    not knowing for certain if someone else is even there.

    in the desert. You are my history book. I used to not believe
    in fairy tales till I played the dunce in sheep’s clothing
    
    and felt how perfectly your foot fit in the glass slipper
    of my ass. But then duty wrapped its phone cord
    
    around my ankle and yanked me across the continent.
    And now there are three thousand miles between the u
    
    and s in esophagus. And being without you is like standing
    at a cement-filled wall with a roll of Yugoslavian nickels
    
    and making a wish. Some days I miss you so much
    I’d jump off the roof of your office building
    
    just to catch a glimpse of you on the way down. I wish
    we could trade left eyeballs, so we could always see
    
    what the other sees. But you’re here, I’m there,
    and we have only words, a nightly phone call - one chance
    
    to mix feelings into syllables and pour into the receiver,
    hope they don’t disassemble in that calculus of wire.

    title: `The Couple Next Door`,
    poet: `Kim Dower`,
    text: `The couple next door reads all day long.
    I can see them from our adjoining hotel patios
    high above the sea.
    
    The couple next door sits
    at a round white plastic table on hard chairs,
    their books touching as they
    
    turn their pages at the same time.
    I listen for any sounds they might make:
    soft cough, sigh of joy,
    
    I hear nothing except for southbound traffic
    on Pacific Coast Highway, distant
    waves, morning sounds of housekeepers
    
    cleaning the grounds below our deck.
    The man’s book looks fat; I see him
    thick glasses brand new cap
    
    staring intently into the page,
    I never see him smile so I know the book is not funny.
    I never see him shake his head so I know the book does not
    
    confuse him, but he suddenly lifts his head
    looks out at the ocean, puts his hand over his mouth.
    The woman looks content like her book understands her:
    
    it’s about something she knows too well––
    bringing up children, watching them grow,
    saying goodbye.
    
    I brought books too but prefer watching them:
    wonder how they arrived at this place
    where reading in silence carries them through the day.

    title: `It was like this: you were happy`,
    poet: `Jane Hirshfield`,
    text: `It was like this:
    you were happy, then you were sad,
    then happy again, then not.
    
    It went on.
    You were innocent or you were guilty.
    Actions were taken, or not.
    
    At times you spoke, at other times you were silent.
    Mostly, it seems you were silent – what could you say?
    
    Now it is almost over.
    
    Like a lover, your life bends down and kisses your life.
    
    It does this not in forgiveness –
    between you, there is nothing to forgive –
    but with the simple nod of a baker at the moment
    he sees the bread is finished with transformation.
    
    Eating, too, is a thing now only for others.
    
    It doesn’t matter what they will make of you
    or your days: they will be wrong,
    they will miss the wrong woman, miss the wrong man,
    all the stories they tell will be tales of their own invention.
    
    Your story was this: you were happy, then you were sad,
    you slept, you awakened.
    Sometimes you ate roasted chestnuts, sometimes persimmons.

    title: `Apartment Living`,
    poet: `Meghan O’Rourke`,
    text: `So those despotic loves have become known to you,
    rubbing cold hands up your thighs, leaving oily trails,
    whispering, Just how you like it, right?
    Upstairs the sorority girls are playing charades
    again, smoking cigarettes, wearing shifts, burning
    pain into their synapses.
    Life is a needle. And now it pricks you:
    the silver light in which you realize
    your attempts at decadence
    tire the earth and tire you. The etymology
    of “flag” as in “to signal to stop”
    is unknown. It is time to sit and watch. Don’t
    call that one again, he’s pitiless in his self-certainty.
    You used to be so.
    You laid your black dress on the bed.
    You stepped in your heels over sidewalk cracks.
    You licked mint and sugar from the cocktail mixer,
    singing nonsense songs,
    and the strangers, they sang along.

    title: `Things`,
    poet: `Lisel Mueller`,
    text: `What happened is, we grew lonely
    living among the things,
    so we gave the clock a face,
    the chair a back,
    the table four stout legs
    which will never suffer fatigue.
    
    We fitted our shoes with tongues
    as smooth as our own
    and hung tongues inside bells
    so we could listen
    to their emotional language,
    
    and because we loved graceful profiles
    the pitcher received a lip,
    the bottle a long, slender neck.
    
    Even what was beyond us
    was recast in our image;
    we gave the country a heart,
    the storm an eye,
    the cave a mouth
    so we could pass into safety.

    title: `Art Is a Facebook Status About Your Winter Break`,
    poet: `B.E. Fitzgerald`,
    text: `I swear to every heaven ever imagined,
    if I hear one more dead-eyed hipster
    tell me that art is dead, I will personally summon Shakespeare
    from the grave so he can tell them every reason
    why he wishes he were born in a time where
    he could have a damn Gmail account.
    The day after I taught my mother
    how to send pictures over Iphone she texted
    me a blurry image of our cocker spaniel ten times in a row.
    Don’t you dare try to tell me that that is not beautiful.
    But whatever, go ahead and choose to stay in
    your backwards-hoping-all-inclusive club
    while the rest of us fall in love over Skype.
    Send angry letters to state representatives,
    as we record the year’s first sunrise so
    we can remember what beginning feels like when
    we are inches away from the trigger.
    Lock yourself away in your Antoinette castle
    while you eat cake and tweet to the whole universe that we did.
    Hashtag you’re a pretentious asshole.
    Van Gogh would have taken 20 selfies a day.
    Sylvia Plath would have texted her lovers
    nothing but heart eyed emojis when she ran out of words.
    Andy Warhol would have had the world’s weirdest Vine account,
    and we all would have checked it every morning while we
    Snap Chat our coffee orders to the people
    we wish were pressed against our lips instead of lattes.
    This life is spilling over with 85 year olds
    rewatching JFK’s assassination and
    7 year olds teaching themselves guitar over YouTube videos.
    Never again do I have to be afraid of forgetting
    what my father’s voice sounds like.
    No longer must we sneak into our families phonebook
    to look up an eating disorder hotline for our best friend.
    No more must I wonder what people in Australia sound like
    or how grasshoppers procreate.
    I will gleefully continue to take pictures of tulips
    in public parks on my cellphone
    and you will continue to scoff and that is okay.
    But I hope, I pray, that one day you will realize how blessed
    you are to be alive in a moment where you can google search
    how to say I love you in 164 different languages.
