# The Reverse Dementor Project

Cool name right? Some day I am going to make this project worthy of it.

This is a website I made for my girlfriend. The basic premise is that the website is the opposite of a dementor. It sucks all your fear and sadness away.

Mostly it is just a bunch of cat gifs and poems. 

Uses React.
